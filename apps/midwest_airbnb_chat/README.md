# Midwest Airbnb Chat

**Ask a question in plain English, get the SQL and a table back**

A querychat app built for Midwest Airbnb listings.

**Live app:** https://midwest-airbnb-chat-3bk2.onrender.com

---

## What is this app?

The app connects to a SQLite database (`data/midwest_airbnb.db`), hands the `listings` table to an LLM, and generates SQL queries to answer questions about 14,887 Airbnb listings across Chicago, Columbus, and the Twin Cities.
---

## Dataset Information

**Dataset:** `scout_postings` table in `data/scout.db` (1,891 rows, 19 columns)
**Source:** ChatISA Job Scout, which harvested the postings from public job boards between July 29 and August 23, 2026 (the `source` column records the board: `activejobs` or `usajobs`)
**Data dictionary:** `data/data_desc.md` (started in class; you complete it in Assignment 05)
**Query rules for the LLM:** `data/extra_instructions.md` (one starter rule; you add more)

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `title` | Job title as it appeared on the board |
| `company` | Employer name |
| `location_city` | City of the posting (blank for 61 rows) |
| `location_state` | Two-letter state code (blank for 30 rows) |
| `remote` | `1` if the posting is remote, `0` otherwise |
| `category` | `fulltime`, `federal`, or `internship` |

## Required Secret

The app calls OpenAI (`gpt-5.6-luna (reasoning off)`) through [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/), so it needs one environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

On Hugging Face Spaces, add it under **Settings > Variables and secrets** as a secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Never commit the key; `.Renviron` is listed in `.gitignore` for that reason.

## Running Locally
